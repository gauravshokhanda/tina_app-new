            We offer a range of services, including options not commonly provided
            by other companies, such as online payment. While we prefer cans to
            be placed at the end of the driveway or curbside, we understand this
            may not always be possible, so we also offer off-curb pickups at an
            additional cost.

        <Text className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            Appalachian Trash-B-Gone takes pride in being a locally owned and

            By choosing our services, you support a local enterprise and ensure
            that your investment stays within the community. We appreciate the

            Our mission is to provide trash removal at the lowest cost possible
            with the best customer service. Being a family-owned and operated
            business allows us to keep our costs lower than our competitors. We
            take pride in our service and won’t leave our customers disappointed.
            We offer additional services that other trash removal companies
            don’t offer, including online payment options, text message alerts,
            and DOT certification. Our goal is to please our customers! We thank
            all of our past and future customers for supporting our local family
            business.
